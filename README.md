# Python-API-Assignment

This program will allow the user to search for moives using an IMDB api, presents the user with relevant information regarding the selected movie
and give them a link to where they could watch it (provided the movie is available on streaming platforms).

The user can also request a random recommendation, which is done by searching through IMDB using a pseudo-randomized seven digit movie ID (ie tt#######).

To use the application you will need the Python Requests module installed, which can be done by navigating to the directory where Python is installed and
run pip install requests. Once this is done you will be able to run the application in your terminal.
